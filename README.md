# 1. Navigate to the root directory of your React Native project:

cd path/to/project

# 2. Start the Expo development server:

expo start

# 3. In the terminal, you will see a QR code.

# 4. Download the Expo app:

# - iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779

# - Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US

# 5. Open the Expo app and scan the QR code from the terminal. This will open the app on your device.

# Troubleshooting:

# - If you are experiencing issues running the app, try stopping the Expo development server (with `ctrl+c`) and starting it again with `expo start`.

# - Make sure that your iOS or Android device is connected to the same network as your computer.

# - If you are unable to scan the QR code, you can also open the app by selecting it from the Projects tab in the Expo app.
